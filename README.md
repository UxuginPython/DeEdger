# DeEdger
On Windows 11 and sometimes on Windows 10, Microsoft has attempted to block users from uninstalling their browser, Microsoft Edge. This is a tool to circumvent this prevention and uninstall Edge anyway.
**Note: Since 1.1.0, SmartScreen may block this from running. To bypass it, click More Info, then Run Anyway**
